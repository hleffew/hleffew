**Suitability Level:**

**SUITABLE** – No psychological traits or behavioral patterns have been
identified that are expected to significantly interfere with the
performance of essential job functions. In some cases, an applicant may
even be particularly well suited for the position. Although there may be
areas of concern, they are not reflective of an overarching pattern
incompatible with employment in public safety and are not independently
serious or disqualifying.

**MARGINALLY SUITABLE** - There are serious concerns about psychological
traits and behavioral patterns that could interfere with the performance
of essential job functions, though given what we have reviewed at the
time of this evaluation, the applicant would be considered suitable.
Before making any final hiring determinations, the agency should
investigate further the concerns noted in the report. Concerns may stem
from only one particular area of an applicant’s history, presentation,
or testing results. It is also possible that, when combined,
independently less severe concerns depict a historical pattern, or
likely future displays, of potentially problematic behavior.

**<u>UNSUITABLE</u>** – Psychological traits and behavioral patterns
have been identified that are expected to significantly interfere with
the performance of essential job functions. Indications of poor
suitability may relate to a singular area of an applicant’s history,
presentation, or testing results. An applicant may also be deemed
unsuitable due to multiple factors that, when combined, reflect clear
and critically concerning behaviors incompatible with employment in
public safety.

**INCONCLUSIVE **– We are unable to form an opinion regarding this
applicant's suitability due to insufficient information.

**Confidential Pre-Employment Psychological Evaluation**

**Post-Conditional Offer**

The above-named applicant was individually interviewed and completed,
depending on the stage of evaluation, measures of normal and abnormal
personality. When available and appropriate, collateral data are also
reviewed. This pre-employment suitability assessment should be
considered as only one aspect of the selection process. The agency
should make the final hiring decision only after carefully considering
data from all parts of the entire pre-employment process.

The recommendation given herein is only intended for the position the
applicant was evaluated for and is invalid for use in hiring or
assignment decisions after one year. The pre-employment suitability
assessment does not constitute the provision of healthcare, as this
assessment’s sole purpose is to aid in an employer’s selection process
and is not relevant to diagnosis or treatment of any kind.

This pre-employment suitability assessment aims to identify traits and
behaviors relevant to job suitability, specifically, the ability to
reliably perform essential job duties and functions for the reported
public safety position. This evaluation is based on information provided
by the applicant in response to a standardized supplemental
questionnaire, a structured interview, and any assessments listed on the
third page of this report. The information gathered from applicants is
focused on behavior relevant to the job elements required by the
position, and the requesting agency should verify the accuracy of this
self-reported information. The requesting agency should review any
identified concerns through the background investigation and polygraph
examination.

The ADA requires that medical/psychological examinations of employees be
treated as confidential records. Therefore, this report should be stored
in a separate medical file with limited access and not in any hired
applicant’s personnel file. The information contained within this report
must be kept confidential except when necessary to inform supervisors
about work restrictions or accommodations that may be required. This
report is neither designed nor intended to become part of an applicant’s
personal health information. Pre-employment psychological assessments
are not considered treatment and are not subject to HIPAA guidelines for
clinical records.

**Possible Suitability Levels**

Psychological test results, interview information, and, when available,
collateral data are integrated to determine the suitability rating.

    been identified that are expected to significantly interfere with
    the performance of essential job functions. In some cases, an
